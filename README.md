# Frontend Boilerplate

A modern, customizable boilerplate for building web frontends using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** — designed for fast development and scalable architecture.


## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React framework for production
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – Static typing for JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework

## Features

- Minimal, clean project structure
- Preconfigured TypeScript and Tailwind setup
- Easy scalability for large frontend projects

## Getting Started

## For Windows
Clone the repository and run the setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-boilerplate-js.git
cd frontend-boilerplate-js
npm install
npm run dev
```
## For Linux/macOS

## Project Setup and Run Instructions

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (for running shell scripts)
- Necessary dependencies (defined inside `setup.sh`)

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the setup script:

```bash
cd scripts
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The `setup.sh` script will install all required dependencies and perform the necessary project setup.

---

## Running the Project

Once setup is complete:

```bash
cd scripts
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

This will start the project.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have execute permissions for both scripts using:
  ```bash
  chmod +x scripts/setup.sh scripts/start.sh
  ```
- If you encounter permission issues, try running with `sudo` (only if necessary):
  ```bash
  sudo ./setup.sh
  sudo ./start.sh
  ```
